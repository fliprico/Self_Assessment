# Self Assessment

## Cohesive written analysis:

I populated and managed the AWS RDS database and connected it to pgAdmin, updating schemas to pull the necessary tables for analysis, played a crucial role in the US Adidas Sales Data analysis project. 

I was responsible for ensuring that the database was populated with relevant and up-to-date data, which was then used for analysis purposes.

This involved several important tasks, such as setting up the AWS RDS database, connecting it to pgAdmin, and updating the database schemas to pull the necessary tables for analysis. 

This was a complex process, as it required a high level of technical expertise, as well as an understanding of the data structure and relationships. The person was responsible for ensuring that the database was properly configured and optimized to allow for seamless data retrieval and analysis.

One of the greatest personal challenge that I faced over the course of the project was maintaining the accuracy of the data in the database. Given the large volume of data involved, there was a high risk of data corruption, which would have resulted in inaccurate analysis results. 

To overcome this challenge, the person implemented several data quality control measures, such as data validation checks, data reconciliation processes, and regular data backups, to ensure the accuracy of the data in the database.

This role was invaluable in providing the data necessary to produce meaningful insights and recommendations for the business.

## Cohesive written summary:

First, regarding the Tableau visualizations, I contributed through team discussions and peer reviews by providing valuable insights and suggestions on how to effectively visualize the data to help uncover important patterns and relationships. My suggestions helped improve the overall quality and usefulness of the Tableau visualizations, leading to better insights and conclusions.

I also contributed to the ETL process to clean the dataset in Python by reviewing and commenting on the code, suggesting improvements to the cleaning process, or testing the cleaned data for accuracy. This helped ensure that the data was properly cleaned and prepared for analysis, leading to more reliable results.

Finally, I also contributed to the development of the machine learning model algorithm. This involved reviewing the model and its results, or suggesting improvements to the algorithm. This helped ensure that the machine learning model was robust, accurate, and well-suited to the data, leading to better predictions and insights.

## Project Summary:

The team started by collaborating on a project goal and creating a comprehensive dashboard to keep track of each member's contributions and progress. Regular and open communication across multiple channels such as Slack & WhatsApp ensured the project remained on track and aligned with established timelines.

The team's success was largely due to their strong planning and time management skills. Efficient task delegation and follow-up processes ensured that all work was completed on schedule and met high quality standards. Additionally, each team member's unique strengths were leveraged effectively throughout the project, resulting in a well-rounded and successful outcome.

We used Cluster Analysis using K-means and PCA to determine population clusters in terms of total population, median income and median age on US Census Data, Supervised machine learning using multiple ML algorithms to predict operating margin based on input classifications and Multiple Linear Regression using Random Forest Regressor to predict future sales and operating profit per state based on population data and historic sales data.
